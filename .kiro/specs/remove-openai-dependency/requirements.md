# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The procurement analysis tool currently has an unused OpenAI dependency that creates confusion and unnecessary complexity. The application actually uses OpenWebUI for AI functionality and performs all core analysis through mathematical algorithms. This feature will remove the OpenAI dependency and clean up the configuration to reflect the actual architecture.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the procurement tool, I want to remove unused dependencies so that the codebase is clean and deployment is simplified.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing package.json THEN the openai package SHALL be removed from dependencies
2. WHEN checking environment variables THEN OpenAI-specific variables SHALL be removed or renamed appropriately
3. WHEN examining the codebase THEN no references to unused OpenAI imports SHALL remain
4. WHEN running the application THEN all functionality SHALL work exactly as before

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation about the AI integration so that I understand which service is actually being used.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reading the configuration THEN it SHALL be clear that OpenWebUI is used for AI features
2. WHEN reviewing environment variables THEN they SHALL have descriptive names that indicate OpenWebUI usage
3. WHEN checking documentation THEN it SHALL accurately reflect the OpenWebUI integration
4. WHEN examining the code THEN comments SHALL clarify the AI service being used

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to gracefully handle AI service unavailability so that core analysis features continue working.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the OpenWebUI service is unavailable THEN mathematical analysis SHALL continue to work
2. WHEN AI commentary fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback messages
3. WHEN network issues occur THEN error handling SHALL be graceful and informative
4. WHEN AI features are disabled THEN core procurement analysis SHALL remain fully functional
